# Time Block Your Life
## Made at UofT Hacks VII - 36 Hour Project
Front-End: Justin Zhang 

Back-End: Kevin Cheung, Shuhb Shah, Sammi Yeung

### The Project
Made using React.js, Python, HTML, CSS, Google Cloud. The project focuses on making you more productive.

I worked on the front-end development with React.js, HTML, and CSS. I also utilized React Animations and researched motion libraries such as Framer Motion, Springer, and React Transition Library.

### What does it do?
The project gives the user an intuitive user interface to keep track of their school work and assignments. The program will then automatically create events in their personal calendar and block out time for them to complete their work.
